# DEC-Transformer
- This project is a code implementation of the paper "DEC-Transformer: Deep Embedded Clustering with Transformer on Chinese Long Text", which is being submitted to the journal Pattern Analysis and Applications.
- The project includes a number of research experiments covered in the thesis, some of the intermediate files cannot be uploaded due to the large space taken by the platform. The project is still in a state of follow-up, and further code and important experimental results may be added in the future.
- This project uses an open source pre-trained language model, for which we are grateful for the work carried out atï¼š
